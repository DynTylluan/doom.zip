This is The Sky May Be, retooled to be 99% Compatible with Zdoom (a few 
things don't work right w/o the DOS prompt). 

It's meant to provide easier access to the people who can't get the DeHackEd
patch to install or get past the original install method.

This combined, decompressed version of The Sky May Be was hacked together by
Linkrulezall.

However, he takes NO CREDIT WHATSOEVER for the contents of the wad, nor is
he affiliated in any way with Doug the Eagle or Kansam.

(But if he did, they'd definitely be on his Xmas card list)
