Hello there, young Internet search astronaut!

You have somehow found my personal Doom file, the idea of this is if I'm ever on someone else's computer, I can
get to play Doom.

All of the software in this file is shareware.

doom1.wad: shareware copy of Doom, v1.9
freedm.wad: Freedoom deathmatch, v0.11.3
freedoom1.wad: Freedoom, v0.11.3
freedoom2.wad: Freedoom II, v0.11.3
crispy-doom-setup.exe: Crispy Doom source port

This ZIP also contains some Doom I and II mods, how nice! (Doom mods will work fine with Freedoom)
